# Jupyter Meets the Earth


This is the project home for the EarthCube-funded project (Awards [1928406](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1928406) and [1928374](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1928374)):
_Jupyter meets the Earth: Enabling discovery in geoscience through interactive computing at scale._

## Project description

The [Jupyter meets the Earth project](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-meets-the-earth-1b0eb33c83f?source=friends_link&sk=945065ffe0c101b6c8ec369425574600) combines research use cases in geosciences with technical developments within the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) and [Pangeo](http://pangeo.io/) ecosystems. In this model of equal partners, scientific questions help drive software infrastructure development, and new technologies expand the horizons of viable research.

The full project description is available in the [original grant proposal](https://zenodo.org/record/3369939).

## What you can find here

In addition to the [project updates and our event archive](#presentations-and-events), here you can find onboarding resources for Jupyter and the other related tools, tailored for Earth science researchers. Jupyter ecosystem helps advance Earth science research in many ways, including data exploration, interactive analysis, documentation, and reproducibility of work. To give you an idea of how Jupyter achieves this, some of these tutorials come along with a motivating example that focuses on real science problems using real data. 

### Our YouTube channel and video resources

[Our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA3Y8FSD0bA7KczpzaE-VRQ) hosts the meeting records and learning resources delivered by the team members. You can also find several playlists introducing our project or Jupyter tools for geoscientists.

## Presentations and events

### Seminars in Taiwan
_July 12, July 15, and August 4-6, 2021_

Team member Whyjay Zheng was invited to host three virtual and in-person workshops in Taiwan (at Taiwan University, Taiwan Normal University, and Cheng Kung University, respectively), aiming to engage the international Earth science community with the Jupyter ecosystem and tools.

### 2021 EarthCube annual meeting
_June 15-17, 2021_

In addition to the update about a Cryoscience use case (`EZ-FeatureTrack`), the JMTE project team hosted a workshop entitled "The Jupyter Landscape: a high-level map for (geo)scientists", aiming to provide onboarding resources and tutorials for earth scientists to use Jupyter tools. 

- [EZ-FeatureTrack project notebook](https://github.com/earthcube2021/ec21_zheng_etal): an interactive, Jopyter notebook-based interface that deploys an entire glacier feature tracking workflow. This open-source tool aims to provide researchers, educators, and other users an accessible and reproducible method for mapping glacier velocity over time.
- Jupyter workshop:
  - slides (to be updated)
  - recordings and videos (to be updated)

### The 50th Arctic workshop
_April 15-17, 2021_

We gave a virtual presentation about the Cryoscience use case entitled "Mapping ice flow velocity using an interactive, cloud-based feature tracking workflow":
