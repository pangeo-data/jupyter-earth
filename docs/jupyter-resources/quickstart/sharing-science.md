# Sharing science

Suppose you have done some incredible work and found amazing results. You are now preparing a manuscript to be subbmited to a scientific journal. Together with that, you are making a huge "supplemental information" (SI) package, which contains the data, results, code, and additional documentation... 

Now with the Jupyter ecosystem, you have an option to make your scientific data, workflow, and results more visible to your readers than the paper SI. In addition to that, increased reproducibility of your scientific output will help advance our knowledge in a faster pace.

## Scenario

## Git repo + Binder

## Pass your reseach envoriment to the others

## Make people repeat your workflow
