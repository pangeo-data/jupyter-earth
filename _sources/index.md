# Jupyter Meets the Earth


This is the project home for the EarthCube-funded project (Awards [1928406](https://nsf․gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1928406) and [1928374](https://nsf․gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1928374)):
_Jupyter meets the Earth: Enabling discovery in geoscience through interactive computing at scale._

## Project description

The [Jupyter meets the Earth project](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-meets-the-earth-1b0eb33c83f?source=friends_link&sk=945065ffe0c101b6c8ec369425574600) combines research use cases in geosciences with technical developments within the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) and [Pangeo](http://pangeo.io/) ecosystems. In this model of equal partners, scientific questions help drive software infrastructure development, and new technologies expand the horizons of viable research.

The full project description is available in the [original grant proposal](https://zenodo.org/record/3369939).

## What you can find here

In addition to the [project updates and our event archive](#presentations-and-events), here you can find onboarding resources for Jupyter and the other related tools, tailored for Earth science researchers. Jupyter ecosystem helps advance Earth science research in many ways, including data exploration, interactive analysis, documentation, and reproducibility of work. To give you an idea of how Jupyter achieves this, some of these tutorials come along with a motivating example that focuses on real science problems using real data.
